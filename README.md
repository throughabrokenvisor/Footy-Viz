# Footy-Viz
Welcome welcome! This repository contains codebooks which I used for understanding weird things about football that I found interesting through visualizations. 
That was unnecessarily long!!!!!

Pyhton is the programming language of choie with Google Colab being the working environment. 

Special thanks to FCPython for making vizs super easy.
